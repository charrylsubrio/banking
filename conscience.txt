1. Invincibly Erroneous Conscience: A person genuinely believes something is morally right, even though it is objectively wrong, and they have no reason to believe otherwise.

2. Vincibly Erroneous Conscience: A person makes a mistake in judgment because they haven't put in enough effort to learn about the situation or the moral implications of their actions.

Example: Someone might skip researching a company before accepting a job offer, and later discover the company has unethical labor practices.

3. Perplexed Conscience: A person is genuinely unsure of the morally right course of action, even after seeking guidance and reflection.

Example: A doctor may be unsure whether to perform a risky surgery on a patient, fearing both operating and not operating could have negative consequences.
